# Development Practice React Site

This site was developed with React JS & Tailwind CSS

## Full Stack Web Development with MERN Course

This portfolio serves as a location where I will link up all my practice website builds that I create.  
        Learning with hands-on experience is where we learn the best, as it allows us to experience real world 
        quirks that pop up when coding. So I will be completing a large list of projects that will focus on certain skill sets. Upon completion I will 
        upload them to this site for peer review.
